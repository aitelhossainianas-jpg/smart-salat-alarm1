Smart Salat Alarm – Islamic Companion App

Smart Salat Alarm is a mobile Islamic application designed to help Muslims organize their daily prayers without stress or constant manual adjustments.

Unlike traditional prayer apps that only display prayer times, this application focuses on smart alarms relative to prayer times.
The user chooses how many minutes they need before each prayer (for example: waking up, wudu, walking to the mosque), and the app automatically adjusts the alarm every day, even as prayer times change.

The goal is to allow the user to:

stop calculating prayer times manually

stop changing alarms every few days

focus on prayer instead of time management

Core idea

The user selects a prayer (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha)

The user sets an offset (e.g. 20 minutes before)

The app recalculates the alarm automatically every day based on the real prayer time for the user’s city

Additional Islamic features

The app is designed to be a complete daily Islamic companion, including:

Quran reading and listening

Adkar (morning, evening, after prayer)

Tasbih counter

Educational Islamic reminders

An Islamic quiz game (Wasla-style) for learning in a fun way
